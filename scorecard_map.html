        <h2>Fallon Field</h2>
        <p>So far our group has worked on two finalized designs
            which will begin construction this year. The first is
            Fallon field, located in Roslindale. Our team attended
            several community meetings which were held as part
            of the design process for the playground. In these
            meetings, we functioned as a third party to the city/
            design team and the community, and provided a
            unique voice of compromise from a research
            perspective.<br><br>
            The final design for the Fallon field playground
            features a 35 foot slide, a towering net structure, an
            obstacle course section for smaller children, and a
            large splash pad area.</p>

          <h2>Carter Playground</h2>
          <p>The second project our team was involved with was
              the $26 million project aimed at completely
              renovating and redesigning the Carter playground and
              field. In partnership with the City of Boston, the
              university is rebuilding the playground from the
              ground up as part of its construction of the new
              Interdisciplinary Science &amp; Engineering Complex
              (ISEC). <br><br>
              In addition to attending community meetings for the
              Carter renovation, our team talked with the lead
              designer on the project, Kevin Beuttell. He was very
              receptive to our suggestions and advice, and the final
              design involves many inclusive elements including
              water features and a wheelchair accessible ramp.</p><br>

        <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
        <p>In the spring of March 2015, four of our members set off to San Marcos, Costa
            Rica to work with R.A.W. Tours and help design and construct a playground at a
            local preschool. Two of our members served as lead designers.<br><br>
            The final result is an eco-friendly, colorful, interactive, and diverse playground to
            replace the overgrown and hazardous space in which the preschoolers used to
            play. Bright paint helped breathe life into the metal fence and plastic bottles, and
            the tires helped create levels and terracing. A mosaic of shattered tiles weaves a
            path through the concrete from the grassy area to the stage. The project was very
            inexpensive, and completed within a typical 40-hour work week. Our members
            love working on Boston playgrounds, but feel so fortunate to have had the
            opportunity to bring their passion for playgrounds abroad.</p><br>

        <p>We wanted to see how Boston compares to other major cities
            throughout the country, and what factors are drivers of the quality of
            play. We ran a survey of the most inclusive playgrounds in 14 major
            cities, measuring each playgroundâ€™s features, maintenance and
            safety, inclusivity, and overall quality. Using the information that we
            gathered from other cities, we provided recommendations for Boston
            to improve its quality of play.</p>

        <p>The following report is a formal response from a Northeastern
            student research organization to the Carter Playground Design Survey
            and community meetings. The goal is to explain and defend the
            importance of inclusive play elements in the design of the new Carter
            Playground. Wevinvestigated and addressed each portion of the
            design survey, highlighting elements most beneficial to collaborative
            growth between children of all abilities.</p>

            liked, those that are small improvements that we felt could be easily
            made, as well as larger changes that might be more extreme or cost
            intensive.</p>

    <h1>Our Work</h1>

    <p>We advocate for inclusive playground design in Boston to
        meet the needs of children with disabilities. We accomplish
        this through collaboration with the Boston Parks and
        Recreation Department, research into inclusive play
        equipment, and scoring playgrounds throughout Boston.
        We have built a scorecard that measures the quality, safety,
        and inclusivity of play spaces. These results help us to identify
        the needs of different communities. We share our findings at
        conferences and get others involved in evaluating the quality
        of play in their hometowns.</p>

    <h1>Featured Playgrounds</h1>

    <h2>Fallon Field</h2>

    <p>So far our group has worked on two finalized designs
        which will begin construction this year. The first is
        Fallon field, located in Roslindale. Our team attended
        several community meetings which were held as part
        of the design process for the playground. In these
        meetings, we functioned as a third party to the city/
        design team and the community, and provided a
        unique voice of compromise from a research
        perspective.
        The final design for the Fallon field playground
        features a 35 foot slide, a towering net structure, an
        obstacle course section for smaller children, and a
        large splash pad area.</p>

    <h2>Carter Playground</h2>

    <p>The second project our team was involved with was
        the $26 million project aimed at completely
        renovating and redesigning the Carter playground and
        field. In partnership with the City of Boston, the
        university is rebuilding the playground from the
        ground up as part of its construction of the new
        Interdisciplinary Science & Engineering Complex
        (ISEC).
        In addition to attending community meetings for the
        Carter renovation, our team talked with the lead
        designer on the project, Kevin Beuttell. He was very
        receptive to our suggestions and advice, and the final
        design involves many inclusive elements including
        water features and a wheelchair accessible ramp.</p>

    <h2>Costa Rica</h2>

    <p>In the spring of March 2015, four of our members set off to San Marcos, Costa
        Rica to work with R.A.W. Tours and help design and construct a playground at a
        local preschool. Two of our members served as lead designers.
        The final result is an eco-friendly, colorful, interactive, and diverse playground to
        replace the overgrown and hazardous space in which the preschoolers used to
        play. Bright paint helped breathe life into the metal fence and plastic bottles, and
        the tires helped create levels and terracing. A mosaic of shattered tiles weaves a
        path through the concrete from the grassy area to the stage. The project was very
        inexpensive, and completed within a typical 40-hour work week. Our members
        love working on Boston playgrounds, but feel so fortunate to have had the
        opportunity to bring their passion for playgrounds abroad.</p>

    <h1>Reports</h1>

    <h2>2016 Summer Research Fellowship Report</h2>

    <button>Full Report → </button>

    <p>We wanted to see how Boston compares to other major cities
        throughout the country, and what factors are drivers of the quality of
        play. We ran a survey of the most inclusive playgrounds in 14 major
        cities, measuring each playground’s features, maintenance and
        safety, inclusivity, and overall quality. Using the information that we
        gathered from other cities, we provided recommendations for Boston
        to improve its quality of play.</p>

    <h2>Carter Design Survey Inclusivity Report</h2>

    <button>Full Report → </button>

    <p>The following report is a formal response from a Northeastern
        student research organization to the Carter Playground Design Survey
        and community meetings. The goal is to explain and defend the
        importance of inclusive play elements in the design of the new Carter
        Playground. Wevinvestigated and addressed each portion of the
        design survey, highlighting elements most beneficial to collaborative
        growth between children of all abilities.</p>

    <h2>Healy Playground Design Report</h2>

    <button>Full Report → </button>

    <p>This report was made in preparation for our meeting with the Copley
        Wolff Design Group and Cathy Baker-Eclipse of Boston Parks and
        Recreation, aiming to provide our opinion on the inclusivity of the
        current design. We broke it down into aspects of the designs that we
        liked, those that are small improvements that we felt could be easily
        made, as well as larger changes that might be more extreme or cost
        intensive.</p>
